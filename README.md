## 🧰 Project Summary  
- **Dataset**: Business/consumer dataset (processed for regression analysis)  
- **Source**: Provided CSV dataset, cleaned and analyzed in Jupyter/Colab  
- **Focus**:  
  - Data cleaning & preprocessing  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
  - Feature engineering & multicollinearity checks  
  - Linear regression model building  
  - Regularization with **Ridge** and **Lasso**  
  - Residual analysis and evaluation

## 🔍 Key Findings  

📉 **Multicollinearity Impact**  
- Detected high correlation among predictors (via VIF).  
- Ridge & Lasso reduced instability by penalizing coefficients.  

📈 **Model Performance**  
- Multiple regression improved predictive power vs simple regression.  
- Regularization balanced bias–variance trade-off.  

⚖️ **Residual Analysis**  
- Residuals validated linear regression assumptions.  
- Highlighted areas where model fit could be improved.

## 📊 Tools & Libraries  
🐍 Python (Colab environment)  
📦 pandas, numpy for data wrangling  
📈 matplotlib, seaborn for visualization  
🤖 scikit-learn for regression models (Linear, Ridge, Lasso)  
📊 statsmodels for statistical inference  

---

## 🧠 Takeaways  
- Regression models explain variable relationships & drivers of outcomes.  
- Regularization is essential when predictors are correlated.  
- Residual analysis ensures model assumptions hold.  
- Coefficient interpretation translates model results into **business insights**.  

---

## 📎 Notes  
- Standardization applied before regularization.  
- Feature selection guided by VIF and domain context.  
- Results reproducible in Jupyter/Colab.

## ✅ Next Steps  
- Extend regression into **non-linear modeling** (Polynomial, ElasticNet).  
- Experiment with **tree-based models** for improved accuracy.  
- Deploy findings in a **dashboard (Tableau/Streamlit)** for business use.
